 # What are the benefits of github?
 - It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects
 - GitHub is a repository 
 GitHub is a repository and it allows your work to get out there in front of the public.
 - Track changes in your code across versions meaning When multiple people work on a project, it’s hard to keep track of who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. 

Here is a basic overview of how Git works:

- Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
- Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
- Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
- "Push" your changes to your main branch
- Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
- "Pull" the changes to your local machine
- Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
- Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
- "Merge" your branch to the main branch
